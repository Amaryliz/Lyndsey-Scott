      Lyndsey Scott grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, as the eldest of four
      children. She attended Amherst College, where she studied theatre,
      economics, and physics, before taking computer science. She graduated
      Amherst College in 2006 with a joint degree in theatre and computer
      science.

      After college, Scott was more interested in acting than computer science,
      and began pursuing auditions in New York City. With the encouragement of
      friends, she applied for modeling work, but was turned down by every
      agency she approached for two years; her parents urged her to take up
      computer science jobs. Scott had, however, put her picture on the website
      Models.com, and in 2008 she was contacted by Click Model Management of New
      York City. Elle Girl featured her in a video about the day of a fashion
      model, including some of her Click new model training. She was then 24,
      which was considered old for a model. The agency asked her to trim five
      years from her age, and for her first few years modeling she claimed to
      have been born in 1990. During New York Fashion Week, she became the first
      black model to sign an exclusive runway contract with Calvin Klein.
